-- EDA

-- Here we are jsut going to explore the data and find trends or patterns or anything interesting like outliers

-- normally when you start the EDA process you have some idea of what you're looking for

-- with this info we are just going to look around and see what we find!

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- EASIER QUERIES

SELECT MAX(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;






-- Looking at Percentage to see how big these layoffs were
SELECT MAX(percentage_laid_off),  MIN(percentage_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE  percentage_laid_off IS NOT NULL;

-- Which companies had 1 which is basically 100 percent of they company laid off
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE  percentage_laid_off = 1;
-- these are mostly startups it looks like who all went out of business during this time

-- if we order by funcs_raised_millions we can see how big some of these companies were
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE  percentage_laid_off = 1
ORDER BY funds_raised_millions DESC;
-- BritishVolt looks like an EV company, Quibi! I recognize that company - wow raised like 2 billion dollars and went under - ouch
















-- SOMEWHAT TOUGHER AND MOSTLY USING GROUP BY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Companies with the biggest single Layoff

SELECT company, total_laid_off
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- now that's just on a single day

-- Companies with the most Total Layoffs
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;



-- by location
SELECT location, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- this it total in the past 3 years or in the dataset

SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

SELECT YEAR(date), SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY YEAR(date)
ORDER BY 1 ASC;


SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


SELECT stage, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY stage
ORDER BY 2 DESC;






-- TOUGHER QUERIES------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Earlier we looked at Companies with the most Layoffs. Now let's look at that per year. It's a little more difficult.
-- I want to look at 

WITH Company_Year AS 
(
  SELECT company, YEAR(date) AS years, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
  FROM layoffs_staging2
  GROUP BY company, YEAR(date)
)
, Company_Year_Rank AS (
  SELECT company, years, total_laid_off, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS ranking
  FROM Company_Year
)
SELECT company, years, total_laid_off, ranking
FROM Company_Year_Rank
WHERE ranking <= 3
AND years IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY years ASC, total_laid_off DESC;




-- Rolling Total of Layoffs Per Month
SELECT SUBSTRING(date,1,7) as dates, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY dates
ORDER BY dates ASC;

-- now use it in a CTE so we can query off of it
WITH DATE_CTE AS 
(
SELECT SUBSTRING(date,1,7) as dates, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY dates
ORDER BY dates ASC
)
SELECT dates, SUM(total_laid_off) OVER (ORDER BY dates ASC) as rolling_total_layoffs
FROM DATE_CTE
ORDER BY dates ASC;
